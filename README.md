# COW
A [COW](https://bigzaphod.github.io/COW) interpreter written in C

I know the interpreter for this already exists, but I re-wrote it from C++ to C in order to make it a lot more lightweight. I've also provided the binary executables in the [releases](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/COW/releases) page. It works just like my [BrainF](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/BrainF) interpreter.
